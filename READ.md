# Virtual Engine Project

## Overview
The Virtual Engine is a multifunctional project that incorporates complex mathematical operations, bot utilities, a database manager, natural language processing (NLP) engine, question classifier, data recorder, session manager, and integration with Twitter. This project is implemented using C++ and Python.

## Project Structure

### C++ Files

#### 1. `main.cpp`
The main entry point for the C++ components of the project, it initializes and demonstrates the various functionalities provided by the different modules.

#### 2. `ComplexMathOperations.cpp`
Contains functions and classes to perform advanced mathematical operations. This file includes functions for matrix operations, complex numbers, and other high-level calculations.

#### 3. `BotUtilities.cpp`
Provides utility functions to support various bot functionalities, including text processing, data handling, and general utility operations.

#### 4. `DatabaseManager.cpp`
Handles database interactions including CRUD operations. Uses SQLite to manage a local database for storing and retrieving data.

#### 5. `NlpEngine.cpp`
Implements natural language processing capabilities such as tokenization, parsing, and generating responses using pre-trained models and custom algorithms.

#### 6. `QuestionClassifier.cpp`
Classifies incoming questions to generate appropriate responses. Uses machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques to categorize and respond to queries.

#### 7. `DataRecorder.cpp`
Records various types of data generated by the system for logging, analysis, and debugging purposes. Supports writing to text files or any other preferred logging medium.

#### 8. `SessionManager.cpp`
Manages user sessions, tracking the duration and details of each session, and logging session activities to ensure proper session management and reporting.

#### 9. `TwitterClient.cpp`
Integrates with the Twitter REST API to post tweets. Handles OAuth authentication and uses cURL library for HTTP requests.

#### 10. `TwitterStreamClient.cpp`
Integrates with the Twitter Streaming API to track real-time data such as tweets containing specific keywords. Processes and logs incoming stream data in real time.

### Python File

#### `main.py`
A Python script that interacts with Twitter using the `tweepy` library. It posts tweets and tracks real-time data based on specific keywords. This script simulates similar functionality to the C++ components that integrate with Twitter but does not affect the `main.cpp` file.

### Dependencies

#### C++
- `libcurl`
- `OpenSSL`
- `jsoncpp`
- SQLite (Optional depending on database usage)

#### Python
- `tweepy`

### Installation

#### For C++ Components:

1. Install required libraries (`libcurl`, `OpenSSL`, `jsoncpp`, SQLite) using your preferred package manager.

2. Update your `CMakeLists.txt` file to include all the necessary files and link against the required libraries:

    ```cmake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
    
    # Set the project name
    project(Virtual_Engine)
    
    # Specify the C++ standard
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)
    
    # Add the executable
    add_executable(Virtual_Engine main.cpp ComplexMathOperations.cpp BotUtilities.cpp DatabaseManager.cpp NlpEngine.cpp QuestionClassifier.cpp DataRecorder.cpp SessionManager.cpp TwitterClient.cpp TwitterStreamClient.cpp)
    
    # Link against the required libraries
    find_package(CURL REQUIRED)
    find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)
    find_package(JsonCpp REQUIRED)
    
    target_link_libraries(Virtual_Engine PRIVATE CURL::libcurl OpenSSL::SSL jsoncpp_lib)
    ```

3. Build the project using your IDE or command line.

#### For Python Script:

1. Install the required Python library using pip:

    ```sh
    pip install tweepy
    ```

2. Replace the placeholder values in `main.py` (`your_consumer_key`, `your_consumer_secret`, `your_access_token`, `your_access_token_secret`) with your actual Twitter API credentials.

3. Run the Python script:

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

### Usage

#### Running the C++ Main Program:

```sh
./Virtual_Engine
```

#### Running the Python Script:

```sh
python main.py
```
